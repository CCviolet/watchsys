# Here you can add a list of services to monitor. If one is down it 
# can be restarted by executing the default system command,
# which is auto-detected and can be: 
#
# 1. systemctl start <service_name>
# 2. service <service_name>
# 3. /etc/init.d/<service_name>
#
# Also, if you are monitoring a custom process you can specify a custom
# command to restart it.
#
# Examples:
# 
# [Process Name] : [Service Name] : [Start Command]
# apache : apache2 : default
# hiawatha : hiawatha : -c /etc/hiawatha/hiawatha-custom.conf
# named : bind9 : default
